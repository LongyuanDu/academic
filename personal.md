I love running. My personal best for marathon is 3:16:58 at 2016 [Philadelphia Marathon](http://philadelphiamarathon.com/) ([race report](http://www.mountain-du.com/2016/11/2016-philadelphia-marathon/)). I also race in other distances from 10k to 125k.

I used to be an avid wilderness backpacker. My personal favorite is [Denali National Park](https://www.nps.gov/dena/index.htm) ([trip report](http://www.mountain-du.com/2016/09/denali/)). See [my blog](http://www.mountain-du.com/) for more trips.
