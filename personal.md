I love running. My personal best for marathon is 3:11:06 at the 2019 [California International Marathon](https://runsra.org/california-international-marathon/)([race splits](https://www.athlinks.com/event/3241/results/Event/891887/Course/1723361/Bib/3478)). Occasionally I also run ultras. Most recently I finished the 2017 [Lavaredo Ultra Trail](https://www.ultratrail.it/en/) in Italy ([race report](http://www.mountain-du.com/2017/08/lavaredo.html)).


I used to be an avid wilderness backpacker. My favorite place to hike is [Denali National Park](https://www.nps.gov/dena/index.htm) ([trip report](http://www.mountain-du.com/2016/09/denali.html)). I maintain a [personal blog](http://www.mountain-du.com/) where I post trip reports from time to time.
