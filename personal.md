I love running. My personal best for marathon is 3:16:58 at the 2016 [Philadelphia Marathon](http://philadelphiamarathon.com/) ([race report](http://www.mountain-du.com/2016/11/2016-philadelphia-marathon/)). Occasionally I also run ultras. Most recently I finished the 2017 [Lavaredo Ultra Trail](https://www.ultratrail.it/en/) in Italy ([race report](http://www.mountain-du.com/2017/08/lavaredo-2017/)). 


I used to be an avid wilderness backpacker. My favorite place to hike is [Denali National Park](https://www.nps.gov/dena/index.htm) ([trip report](http://www.mountain-du.com/2016/09/denali/)). I maintain a [personal blog](http://www.mountain-du.com/) where I post trip reports from time to time.
